PROJECT VERSION
You should version 5.5.1 or higher installed.

ALLOY-ONLY MATERIALS  
There are 19 materials in this pack that require the Alloy Shader. These material names are appended with _ALLOYONLY 

For all users that do not have Alloy installed, these materials will appear a bright magenta and show Hidden/InternalErrorShader in the Inspector window.  In order to make use of these materials you need to purchase and install the Alloy Physical Shader Framework by heading over to https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11978 and importing it into your project.

If you do not have Alloy, worry not, we have provided standard Unity 5 PBR materials as well that can be found in the same location, without _ALLOYONLY appended to the material name.

These materials look awesome as well and will work perfectly with a stock Unity install.
